# MineiaGo

A proxy to bridge Bedrock (Minecraft Pocket Edition, Minecraft Console Editions and Windows 10 Edition) version ```1.12.0``` with Minecraft PC ```1.14```.
Currently broken (as of the 0.16 update), I'm on it.

## Requirements
* Node.js 6.1.0 or above
* Windows, MacOS or Linux (only tested on MacOS & Windows)

## Install
```
$ git clone https://github.com/filfat/Node-MineiaGo.git && cd Node-MineiaGo && yarn
```

## Usage
It's still in early development, a.k.a "not ready for production"!
```
$ yarn start
```
