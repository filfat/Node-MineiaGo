# MineiaGo (UNDER SLOW DEVELOPMENT)

A proxy to bridge Minecraft Pocket Edition and Windows 10 Edition version ```1.0.x``` with Minecraft PC ```1.12```.
Currently broken (as of the 0.16 update), I'm on it.

## Requirements
* Node.js 6.1.0 or above
* Windows, MacOS or Linux (only tested on MacOS)

## Install
```
$ git clone https://github.com/filfat/MineiaGo.git && cd MineiaGo && npm install
```

## Usage
It's still in early development, a.k.a "not ready for production"!
```
$ npm start
```
